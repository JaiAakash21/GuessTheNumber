Guess the Number Game (JavaScript)

A simple and interactive Guess the Number game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The game generates a random number within a given range, and the player must guess the correct number with hints provided after each attempt.

This project helped me understand JavaScript basics, DOM manipulation, and event handling, making it a great beginner-level project.
